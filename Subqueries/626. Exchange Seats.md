## ðŸŽ¯ Problem 2 : Exchange Seats

### Table: Seat

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |

- `id` is the primary key, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1.
- Each row represents a student with a seat id.

### Task

Swap the seat ids of every two consecutive students.  
If the number of students is odd, the last student's seat id remains unchanged.

Return the result ordered by id ascending.

### Example

Input:

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |

Output:

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |

Explanation:  
The first two students swap their seat ids, the next two also swap, but the last remains unchanged because the count is odd.

### âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
