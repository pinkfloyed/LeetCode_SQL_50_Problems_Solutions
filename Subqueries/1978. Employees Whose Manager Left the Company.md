## ðŸŽ¯ Problem 1 : Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

### Table: Employees

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| manager_id  | int     |
| salary      | int     |

- `employee_id` is the primary key.
- `manager_id` is the ID of the employee's manager; it can be `null`.
- When a manager leaves, their row is deleted but employees still have their `manager_id` set.

### Task

Find the IDs of employees whose salary is strictly less than 30,000 and whose manager has left the company (manager_id does not exist in the table).

Return the result ordered by employee_id.

### Example

Input:

| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |

Output:

| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 11          |

Explanation:  
Employees with salary < 30,000 are 1 and 11.  
Employee 1â€™s manager (11) is still present.  
Employee 11â€™s manager (6) has left the company (no employee with id 6 exists).

### âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 30000
  AND manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)
ORDER BY employee_id;
