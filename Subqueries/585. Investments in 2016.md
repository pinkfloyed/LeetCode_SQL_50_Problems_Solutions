# 🧠 Problem 6 : Investments in 2016

Given an `Insurance` table, find the **total `tiv_2016`** for all policyholders who meet **both** of the following criteria:
1. Their (LAT, LON) location is **unique** — no other policyholder has the same location.
2. There is **at least one other** policyholder with the **same `tiv_2015`** value.

---

## 📋 Task

Write a SQL query to compute the **sum of `tiv_2016`**, rounded to 2 decimal places, for all policyholders satisfying the conditions above.

---

## 📘 Input

Table: `Insurance`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| pid         | int     |
| tiv_2015    | float   |
| tiv_2016    | float   |
| lat         | float   |
| lon         | float   |

- `pid` is the primary key.
- Each row represents one policyholder's data.

---

## 📤 Output

| tiv_2016 |
|----------|
| float    |

A single value representing the total `tiv_2016` for qualifying rows, rounded to two decimal places.

---

## 🔍 Explanation

For each row in the table:
- Only include it if **no other** rows share the same `lat` and `lon`.
- Only include it if **at least one other** row shares the same `tiv_2015`.

---

## 💡 Approach

1. **Filter for unique locations**: Use a subquery to ensure no other row has the same `lat` and `lon`.
2. **Filter for shared `tiv_2015` values**: Use another subquery to ensure there is **more than one** row with that same `tiv_2015`.
3. **Sum the `tiv_2016`** of the rows that pass both filters.
4. Round the result to 2 decimal places.

## 🧾 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance a
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM Insurance b 
    WHERE a.lat = b.lat AND a.lon = b.lon
) = 1
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM Insurance c 
    WHERE a.tiv_2015 = c.tiv_2015
) > 1;
