## ðŸŽ¯ Problem 4 : Restaurant Growth

### Table: Customer

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |

- `(customer_id, visited_on)` is the primary key.
- `amount` is the total paid by a customer on that day.

---

### Task

Compute the moving average of total daily payments over a rolling 7-day window (current day + previous 6 days).  
Return results with:

- `visited_on`
- total `amount` over that window
- `average_amount`, rounded to two decimal places

The result should be ordered by `visited_on` in ascending order.

### Example

#### Input (`Customer` table):

| customer_id | name    | visited_on | amount |
|-------------|---------|------------|--------|
| 1           | Jhon    | 2019-01-01 | 100    |
| 2           | Daniel  | 2019-01-02 | 110    |
| 3           | Jade    | 2019-01-03 | 120    |
| 4           | Khaled  | 2019-01-04 | 130    |
| 5           | Winston | 2019-01-05 | 110    |
| 6           | Elvis   | 2019-01-06 | 140    |
| 7           | Anna    | 2019-01-07 | 150    |
| 8           | Maria   | 2019-01-08 | 80     |
| 9           | Jaze    | 2019-01-09 | 110    |
| 1           | Jhon    | 2019-01-10 | 130    |
| 3           | Jade    | 2019-01-10 | 150    |

#### Output:

| visited_on | amount | average_amount |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2019-01-07 | 860    | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08 | 840    | 120.00         |
| 2019-01-09 | 840    | 120.00         |
| 2019-01-10 | 1000   | 142.86         |

### âœ… SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
  a.visited_on AS visited_on,
  SUM(b.day_sum)   AS amount,
  ROUND(AVG(b.day_sum), 2) AS average_amount
FROM (
  SELECT visited_on, 
         SUM(amount) AS day_sum 
  FROM Customer 
  GROUP BY visited_on
) a,
(
  SELECT visited_on, 
         SUM(amount) AS day_sum 
  FROM Customer 
  GROUP BY visited_on
) b
WHERE DATEDIFF(a.visited_on, b.visited_on) BETWEEN 0 AND 6
GROUP BY a.visited_on
HAVING COUNT(b.visited_on) = 7
ORDER BY a.visited_on;
