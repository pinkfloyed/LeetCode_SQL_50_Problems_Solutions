You are given two tables: `Employee` and `Department`. The goal is to find **high earners** in each department. A high earner is defined as an employee whose **salary is among the top three unique salaries** in their department.

## 📋 Task

Write a SQL query to retrieve the name of the department, the name of the employee, and their salary, **for all employees whose salary is one of the top three unique salaries** in their respective department.

| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |

## 🧪 Example

### Input:

#### Employee

| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |

#### Department

| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |

### Output:

| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |

## 🔍 Explanation

- In **IT** department:
  - Highest unique salary: 90000 → Max
  - Second-highest: 85000 → Joe, Randy
  - Third-highest: 70000 → Will

- In **Sales** department:
  - Highest: 80000 → Henry
  - Second: 60000 → Sam
  - No third-highest (only 2 employees)

---

## 💡 Approach

- Use a **correlated subquery** to count how many distinct salaries are higher than each employee's salary within their department.
- If that count is less than 3, the employee is in the top 3 unique salaries of their department.
- Join the `Employee` and `Department` tables to get department names.

## 🧾 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT d.name AS 'Department', e.name AS 'Employee', e.salary AS 'Salary'
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.salary)
    FROM Employee a
    WHERE a.departmentId = e.departmentId AND a.salary > e.salary
) < 3;
