## üéØ Problem 5 : Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends

### Table: `RequestAccepted`

| Column Name    | Type |
|----------------|------|
| requester_id   | int  |
| accepter_id    | int  |
| accept_date    | date |

- `(requester_id, accepter_id)` is the primary key.
- Each row represents a friendship acceptance between two users.

---

## üîç Explanation

1. **`UNION ALL`** combines both `requester_id` and `accepter_id` into a single column `id`.
2. **`GROUP BY id`** counts how many friendships each user has.
3. **`ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 1`** selects the user with the highest friend count.

## üìå Example

**Input:**

| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016-06-03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09  |

**Output:**

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |

User **3** is friends with **1**, **2**, and **4**, giving them the highest total of **3 friends**.
