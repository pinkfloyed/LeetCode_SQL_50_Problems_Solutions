# Problem 02 - Find Customer Referee

---

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement

Table: **Customer**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |

- `id` is the primary key (unique identifier) for this table.
- Each row in the table indicates:
  - The customerâ€™s `id`
  - Their `name`
  - The `id` of the customer who referred them (can be `NULL` if no one referred them)

---

### Task

Write a SQL query to find the names of customers **who were NOT referred by the customer with id = 2.**

Return the result table in any order.

---

## ðŸ§ª Example

### Input

Customer table:

| id | name | referee_id |
|----|------|------------|
| 1  | Will | NULL       |
| 2  | Jane | NULL       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | NULL       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |

---

### Output

| name |
|------|
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |

**Explanation:**  
- Customers Alex and Mark were referred by customer 2 â†’ so they are excluded.
- All other customers stay in the result.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

- We need to **exclude rows** where `referee_id` is 2.
- Two scenarios are valid:
  - The customer was **not referred by anyone** (i.e. `referee_id` is `NULL`).
  - The customer was referred by someone **other than customer 2** (i.e. `referee_id != 2`).

Hence the `WHERE` clause checks for:
- `referee_id IS NULL` OR
- `referee_id != 2`

---

## âœ… Solution

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;
