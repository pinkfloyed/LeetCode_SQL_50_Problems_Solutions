---

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement

Table: **Products**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |

- `product_id` is the primary key (unique identifier) for this table.
- `low_fats` is an ENUM with values ('Y', 'N'), where 'Y' means the product is low fat.
- `recyclable` is an ENUM with values ('Y', 'N'), where 'Y' means the product is recyclable.

---

### Task

Write a SQL query to find the IDs of products that are **both low fat and recyclable.**

Return the result table in any order.

## ðŸ§ª Example

### Input

Products table:

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

---

### Output

| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

**Explanation:** Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

- We want products where **both conditions are true:**
  - `low_fats = 'Y'`
  - `recyclable = 'Y'`
- We can filter the rows using a `WHERE` clause with an `AND` condition.

---

## âœ… Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
