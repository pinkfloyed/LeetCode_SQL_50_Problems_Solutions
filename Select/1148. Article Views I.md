# Problem 04 - Authors Who Viewed Their Own Articles

---

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement

Table: **Views**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| article_id  | int     |
| author_id   | int     |
| viewer_id   | int     |
| view_date   | date    |

- There is no primary key for this table. The table may contain duplicate rows.
- Each row indicates that a viewer viewed an article written by some author on a certain date.
- If `author_id` and `viewer_id` are the same, it means the author viewed **their own article.**

---

### Task

Write a SQL query to find all authors who have viewed **at least one of their own articles.**

- Return the result table sorted by `id` in ascending order.

## ðŸ§ª Example

### Input

Views table:

| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |

---

### Output

| id  |
|-----|
| 4   |
| 7   |

**Explanation:**  
- Author 7 viewed their own article (article_id 2).
- Author 4 viewed their own article (article_id 3).
- Author 3 never viewed their own articles.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

- We want rows where:
  - `author_id = viewer_id`
- Since an author might view their own articles multiple times, we use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates.
- We rename the column to `id` as required by the output.
- Finally, we sort the results in ascending order.

## âœ… Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY id;
