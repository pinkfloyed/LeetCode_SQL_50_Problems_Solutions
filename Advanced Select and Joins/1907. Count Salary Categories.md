## ðŸŽ¯ Problem 7 : Count Salary Categories

### Table: Accounts

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |

- `account_id` is the primary key.
- Each row contains monthly income information for one bank account.

### Task

Calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category:

- **Low Salary**: incomes strictly less than 20,000
- **Average Salary**: incomes between 20,000 and 50,000 (inclusive)
- **High Salary**: incomes strictly greater than 50,000

Return all three categories even if some have zero accounts.

### Example

Input:

| account_id | income |
|------------|--------|
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |

Output:

| category       | accounts_count |
|----------------|----------------|
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
