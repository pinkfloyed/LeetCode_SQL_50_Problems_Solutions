## ‚úÖ Problem 4 : Consecutive Numbers

**üóÇ Table:** `Logs`

| Column Name | Type   |
|-------------|--------|
| id          | int    |
| num         | varchar |

- `id` is the primary key and an auto-incremented integer.
- Each row captures a number (`num`) logged at a certain step (`id`).

---

## üéØ Task

Identify all distinct numbers that appear **at least three times consecutively** in the `Logs` table.  
Return a single column `ConsecutiveNums` (order does not matter).

---

## üìä Example

### üó≥ Input:

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |

### ‚úÖ Output:

| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |

The number **1** appears in rows 1, 2, and 3 consecutively.

## üõ† Approach 1: Self-Join (Basic & Efficient)

Use a 3-way self-join to ensure three consecutive rows with the same `num`:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT A.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs A
JOIN Logs B ON A.id + 1 = B.id
JOIN Logs C ON B.id + 1 = C.id
WHERE A.num = B.num
  AND B.num = C.num;
```

This selects numbers appearing in three consecutive `id` values :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

## Approach 2: Window Functions (MySQL 8+)

Use `LAG()` and `LEAD()` to compare current row with neighbors:

```sql
WITH Windowed AS (
  SELECT
    num,
    LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev1,
    LEAD(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next1
  FROM Logs
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Windowed
WHERE num = prev1 AND num = next1;
```

This method is clean and works well in modern MySQL versions :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison:

| Method       | Advantages                         | Considerations              |
|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Self‚ÄëJoin    | Fast, simple, works in older MySQL | Requires consecutive `id`s  |
| Window       | Elegant, leverages SQL features    | Requires MySQL 8.0+ support |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Answer (Self‚ÄëJoin Version):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT A.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs A
JOIN Logs B ON A.id + 1 = B.id
JOIN Logs C ON B.id + 1 = C.id
WHERE A.num = B.num
  AND B.num = C.num;
```
