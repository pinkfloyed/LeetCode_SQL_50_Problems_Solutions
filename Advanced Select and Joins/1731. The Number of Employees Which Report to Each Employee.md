## ✅ Problem 1 : The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee

**🗂 Table:** Employees

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| reports_to  | int     |
| age         | int     |

- `employee_id` is the column with unique values for this table.
- This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to.
- Some employees do not report to anyone (`reports_to` is `NULL`).

For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

📝 **Goal:**  
Write a solution to report the IDs and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

## 🎯 Task

Write an SQL query to list all managers with:
- Their `employee_id` and `name`
- The number of employees who report directly to them
- The average age of those employees, rounded to the nearest integer

Return the result ordered by `employee_id`.

## 🔍 Example

### 🗳 Input

Employees table:

| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |

### ✅ Output

| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
|-------------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |

**💡 Explanation:**  
- Hercy has two direct reports: Alice and Bob.
- Their ages are 41 and 36.
- Average age = (41 + 36) / 2 = 38.5 → rounded to **39**.

### 🗳 Input

| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 1           | Michael | null       | 45  |
| 2           | Alice   | 1          | 38  |
| 3           | Bob     | 1          | 42  |
| 4           | Charlie | 2          | 34  |
| 5           | David   | 2          | 40  |
| 6           | Eve     | 3          | 37  |
| 7           | Frank   | null       | 50  |
| 8           | Grace   | null       | 48  |

### ✅ Output

| employee_id | name    | reports_count | average_age |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| 1           | Michael | 2             | 40          |
| 2           | Alice   | 2             | 37          |
| 3           | Bob     | 1             | 37          |

## 🛠 Approach

- Join the `Employees` table to itself:
  - The first instance (`e1`) represents managers.
  - The second instance (`e2`) represents their direct reports.
- Find rows where `e2.reports_to` = `e1.employee_id`.
- Group by manager’s ID and name.
- Count how many employees report to each manager.
- Calculate the average age of direct reports.
- Round the average age to the nearest integer.
- Sort results by `employee_id`.

## 💻 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    e1.employee_id,
    e1.name,
    COUNT(e2.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(e2.age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 
    ON e2.reports_to = e1.employee_id
GROUP BY e1.employee_id, e1.name
ORDER BY e1.employee_id;
```
