## ðŸ›  Approach

1. For each product, find the **maximum** `change_date` that is **â‰¤ 2019-08-16**.
2. If such a date exists, use the corresponding `new_price`.
3. Otherwise, default the price to **10**.
4. Ensure **every distinct product_id** appears in the result.

## ðŸ’» SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
  p.product_id,
  COALESCE(
    (
      SELECT new_price
      FROM Products p2
      WHERE p2.product_id = p.product_id
        AND p2.change_date <= '2019-08-16'
      ORDER BY p2.change_date DESC
      LIMIT 1
    ),
    10
  ) AS price
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT product_id
  FROM Products
) p;
```
