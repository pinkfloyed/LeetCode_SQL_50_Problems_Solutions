## ✅ Problem 2: Primary Department for Each Employee

**🗂 Table:** Employee

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |

- `(employee_id, department_id)` is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
- `employee_id` is the id of the employee.
- `department_id` is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
- `primary_flag` is an ENUM with values ('Y', 'N').
  - If the flag is `'Y'`, the department is the primary department for the employee.
  - If the flag is `'N'`, the department is not the primary department.

📝 **Note:**
- Employees can belong to multiple departments.
- When an employee belongs to only one department, their `primary_flag` is `'N'`. However, that single department should be considered their primary department.

---

## 🎯 Task

Write an SQL query to report all employees along with their **primary department**.  
- For employees who belong to only one department, return their only department as primary.
- For employees who belong to multiple departments, return the department marked with `'Y'` in `primary_flag`.

Return the result table in any order.

## 🔍 Example

### 🗳 Input

Employee table:

| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |

### ✅ Output

| employee_id | department_id |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

**💡 Explanation:**
- Employee 1 belongs only to department 1, so that is their primary department.
- Employee 2 belongs to departments 1 and 2, and department 1 is marked as primary.
- Employee 3 belongs only to department 3, so that is their primary department.
- Employee 4 belongs to departments 2, 3, and 4, and department 3 is marked as primary.

## 🛠 Approach

✅ Find employees who have explicitly marked a primary department:
- Select rows where `primary_flag = 'Y'`.

✅ For employees who belong to only one department:
- Identify employees with exactly one department (count = 1).
- For these, return their single department as primary.

✅ Combine the two sets of employees using `UNION` to avoid duplicates.

## 💻 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'

UNION

SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id, department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
```

---

✅ This ensures:
- Employees with a marked primary department are returned.
- Employees with only one department are included as their own primary.
