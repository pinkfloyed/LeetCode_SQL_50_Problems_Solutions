## âœ… Problem 6 : Last Person to Fit into the Bus

**ðŸ—‚ Table:** `Queue`

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| person_id    | int     |
| person_name  | varchar |
| weight       | int     |
| turn         | int     |

- `person_id` is the primary key.
- `turn` indicates boarding order: 1 = first to board, n = last.
- `weight` is the person's weight in kg.
- The bus has a **weight limit of 1000 kg**.
- Itâ€™s guaranteed the first person (`turn=1`) can fit.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Task

Find the `person_name` of the **last person** who can board the bus without exceeding the 1000 kg limit.  
Return result in any order (single row).

## ðŸ“Š Example

### ðŸ—³ Input (`Queue`):

| person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
|-----------|-------------|--------|------|
| 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
| 3         | Alex        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | John Cena   | 400    | 3    |
| 2         | Marie       | 200    | 4    |
| 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |
| 1         | Winston     | 500    | 6    |

### âœ… Output:

| person_name |
|-------------|
| John Cena   |

**Explanation:**  
- Turn 1: 250 (Alice) â†’ total 250  
- Turn 2: +350 (Alex) â†’ total 600  
- Turn 3: +400 (John Cena) â†’ total 1000  
- Turn 4 would exceed 1000 â†’ stop, so **John Cena** is the last who fits.

## ðŸ›  Approach 1: Nonâ€‘Window (Selfâ€‘Join + Aggregation)

```sql
SELECT q1.person_name
FROM Queue q1
JOIN Queue q2 ON q2.turn <= q1.turn
GROUP BY q1.turn, q1.person_name
HAVING SUM(q2.weight) <= 1000
ORDER BY q1.turn DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- For each `turn`, calculate cumulative sum of weights up to that turn.
- Filter to those â‰¤ 1000, then pick the **highest turn** â†’ the last fit.
