## üõ†Ô∏è Problem 3 : Project Employees I

### Table: Project

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| project_id  | int  |
| employee_id | int  |

- (project_id, employee_id) is the primary key.
- Indicates which employees are assigned to which projects.

---

### Table: Employee

| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |

- employee_id is the primary key.
- experience_years is guaranteed not to be NULL.

---

### ‚ùì Problem Statement

Write an SQL query to report the **average experience years** of all employees for each project.  

- Round the average to 2 decimal places.
- Return the result table in any order.

---

### üì• Example Input

**Project**

| project_id | employee_id |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | 1           |
| 1          | 2           |
| 1          | 3           |
| 2          | 1           |
| 2          | 4           |

**Employee**

| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |

---

### üì§ Example Output

| project_id | average_years |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 2.00          |
| 2          | 2.50          |

---

### üí° Explanation

- **Project 1**:
  - Employees: 1, 2, 3
  - Total experience: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
  - Average = 6 / 3 = 2.00

- **Project 2**:
  - Employees: 1, 4
  - Total experience: 3 + 2 = 5
  - Average = 5 / 2 = 2.50

---

### üß† Approach

- Join `Project` with `Employee` on `employee_id` to fetch each employee‚Äôs experience.
- Group by `project_id`.
- Calculate average experience:
  ```
  average_years = sum(experience_years) / count(*)
  ```
- Round the result to 2 decimal places.

---

### ‚úÖ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(SUM(e.experience_years) / COUNT(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project p
LEFT JOIN 
    Employee e
    ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    p.project_id
ORDER BY 
    p.project_id;
```
