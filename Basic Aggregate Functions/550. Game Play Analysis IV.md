## ðŸŽ¯ Problem 8 : Game Play Analysis IV

### Table: Activity

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |

- `(player_id, event_date)` is the primary key.
- Each row shows a player's activity on a given day.

### Task

Find the fraction of players who logged in again **on the day immediately after** their first login. Round the fraction to 2 decimal places.

### Example

Input:

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

Output:

| fraction |
|----------|
| 0.33     |

Explanation:  
Only player 1 logged in the day immediately after their first login. There are 3 players total, so the fraction is 1/3 = 0.33.

### Approach

1. Identify each playerâ€™s first login date:  
   For each player, find the earliest `event_date` â€” this is their first login.

2. Check if the player logged in the day after their first login:  
   For each player, check if there is a record where they logged in exactly one day after their first login date.

3. Count how many players logged in the day after their first login:  
   Count distinct players who satisfy the above condition.

4. Calculate the total number of players:  
   Count distinct players in the entire table.

5. Calculate the fraction:  
   Divide the count of players who logged in again the next day by the total number of players.

6. Round the result to 2 decimal places:  
   Use SQL's `ROUND()` function to format the output.

### âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT ROUND(
    COUNT(DISTINCT a1.player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2
) AS fraction
FROM Activity a1
JOIN Activity a2
  ON a1.player_id = a2.player_id
 AND a1.event_date = DATE_SUB(a2.event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE a1.event_date = (
    SELECT MIN(event_date)
    FROM Activity a3
    WHERE a3.player_id = a1.player_id
);
