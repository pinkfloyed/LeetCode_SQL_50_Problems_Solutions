## üéØ Problem 5 : Query Quality and Poor Query Percentage

### Table

#### Queries

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |

- This table may contain duplicate rows.
- The `position` column has a value from 1 to 500.
- The `rating` column has a value from 1 to 5.
- A query with a rating less than 3 is called a **poor query**.

---

### ‚ùì Problem Statement

We define **query quality** as:

\[
\text{Quality} = \text{Average of } \left(\frac{\text{rating}}{\text{position}}\right)
\]

We define **poor query percentage** as:

\[
\text{Poor Query Percentage} = \frac{\text{Number of queries with rating < 3}}{\text{Total number of queries}} \times 100
\]

Write a query to report each `query_name`, along with:

- `quality` rounded to 2 decimal places
- `poor_query_percentage` rounded to 2 decimal places

Return the result in any order.

### üì• Example Input

**Queries**

| query_name | result            | position | rating |
|------------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |

### üì§ Example Output

| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
|------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |

---

### üß† Explanation

- For **Dog**:
  - quality = \(\big(\frac{5}{1} + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{200}\big) / 3 = 2.50\)
  - poor_query_percentage = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.33 \)

- For **Cat**:
  - quality = \(\big(\frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{3} + \frac{4}{7}\big) / 3 = 0.66\)
  - poor_query_percentage = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.33 \)

---

### ‚úÖ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(AVG(rating < 3) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM 
    Queries
GROUP BY 
    query_name;
```

---

### üí° Notes

- The condition `(rating < 3)` evaluates to `1` for true and `0` for false in SQL, making it perfect for computing averages.
- We round the results using `ROUND(..., 2)`.
- Division by `position` computes the quality ratio for each row.
