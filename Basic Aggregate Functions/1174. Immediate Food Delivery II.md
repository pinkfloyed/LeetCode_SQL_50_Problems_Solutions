## 🎯 Problem 7 : Immediate Food Delivery II

### Table

#### Delivery

| Column Name                  | Type    |
|------------------------------|---------|
| delivery_id                  | int     |
| customer_id                  | int     |
| order_date                   | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date  | date    |

- `delivery_id` is the primary key.
- The table records food delivery orders and preferred delivery dates.

---

### ❓ Problem Statement

- An order is **immediate** if `customer_pref_delivery_date = order_date`.
- Otherwise, it is a **scheduled** order.
- The first order of a customer is the one with their earliest `order_date`.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate first orders among all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

### 📥 Example Input

**Delivery**

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |

### 📤 Example Output

| immediate_percentage |
|----------------------|
| 50.00                |

---

### 🧠 Explanation

- Customer 1: first order is delivery_id = 1 → scheduled
- Customer 2: first order is delivery_id = 2 → immediate
- Customer 3: first order is delivery_id = 5 → scheduled
- Customer 4: first order is delivery_id = 7 → immediate

2 out of 4 first orders are immediate → percentage = 50.00%

---

### ✅ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(
        AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100,
        2
    ) AS immediate_percentage
FROM
    Delivery
WHERE
    (customer_id, order_date) IN (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            MIN(order_date)
        FROM
            Delivery
        GROUP BY
            customer_id
    );
```

---

### 💡 Notes

- `(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)` evaluates to `1` (true) or `0` (false) in MySQL, which makes it handy for computing averages.
- The WHERE clause ensures we only consider each customer’s first order.
- `AVG(...) * 100` gives the desired percentage.
