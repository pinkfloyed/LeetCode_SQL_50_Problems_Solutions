## üé¨ Problem 1 : Not Boring Movies

**Table: Cinema**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| movie       | varchar |
| description | varchar |
| rating      | float   |

- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row contains the name of a movie, its description, and its rating (a 2-decimal float in the range [0, 10]).

---

### ‚ùì Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to report the movies with:

- an **odd-numbered `id`**
- and a **description that is NOT 'boring'**

Return the result table **ordered by `rating` in descending order**.

### üì• Example Input

**Cinema table:**

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | Irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |

---

### üì§ Example Output

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

---

### üß† Approach

1. **Filter by odd `id`:** Use `MOD(id, 2) <> 0` to get only odd IDs.
2. **Filter out boring descriptions:** Ensure `description != 'boring'`.
3. **Sort by `rating` in descending order** using `ORDER BY rating DESC`.

---

### ‚úÖ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE MOD(id, 2) <> 0
  AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
