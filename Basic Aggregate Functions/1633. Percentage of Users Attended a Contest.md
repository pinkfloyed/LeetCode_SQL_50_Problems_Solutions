## 📊 Problem 4 : Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

### Table: Users

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | int     |
| user_name   | varchar |

- `user_id` is the primary key.
- Each row contains the name and ID of a user.

---

### Table: Register

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| contest_id  | int  |
| user_id     | int  |

- (`contest_id`, `user_id`) is the primary key.
- Indicates which users registered for which contests.

---

### ❓ Problem Statement

Write an SQL query to find the **percentage of users registered** in each contest. Round the result to **2 decimal places**.

- Return the result table ordered by **percentage (descending)**.
- If two contests have the same percentage, order by **contest_id (ascending)**.

### 📥 Example Input

**Users**

| user_id | user_name |
|---------|-----------|
| 6       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 7       | Alex      |

**Register**

| contest_id | user_id |
|------------|---------|
| 215        | 6       |
| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |
| 210        | 6       |
| 208        | 6       |
| 209        | 7       |
| 209        | 6       |
| 215        | 7       |
| 208        | 7       |
| 210        | 2       |
| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |

---

### 📤 Example Output

| contest_id | percentage |
|------------|------------|
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |

---

### 🧠 Approach

1. We want the **percentage of users** who registered for each `contest_id`.
2. First, calculate the **count of unique users** registered in each contest.
3. Divide this count by the **total number of users** (from the `Users` table).
4. Multiply by 100 and round to two decimal places.
5. Apply sorting by percentage (DESC) and contest_id (ASC).

---

### ✅ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    r.contest_id,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT r.user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage
FROM 
    Register r
GROUP BY 
    r.contest_id
ORDER BY 
    percentage DESC, contest_id ASC;
```

---

### 📌 Notes

- `COUNT(DISTINCT r.user_id)` ensures we don't double-count users.
- `ROUND(..., 2)` formats the percentage to two decimal places.
- The nested `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users` gives us the total user count.
