## üõí Problem 2 : Average Selling Price

### Table: Prices

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| product_id  | int  |
| start_date  | date |
| end_date    | date |
| price       | int  |

- (product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key.
- Each row records the price of a product during a date range.
- For each product, there are no overlapping periods.

### Table: UnitsSold

| Column Name    | Type |
|----------------|------|
| product_id     | int  |
| purchase_date  | date |
| units          | int  |

- May contain duplicate rows.
- Each row shows units of a product sold on a given date.

---

### ‚ùì Problem Statement

Write a solution to find the **average selling price** for each product.  

- The average price = total revenue / total units sold.
- Round the result to 2 decimal places.
- If a product has no sales, its average price should be reported as **0.00**.

Return the result table in any order.

| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price |
|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5     |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20    |

| product_id | purchase_date | units |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |

### üì§ Example Output

| product_id | average_price |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |

### üí° Explanation

- **Product 1**:
  - On 2019-02-25, price was 5 ‚Üí revenue = 5 √ó 100 = 500
  - On 2019-03-01, price was 20 ‚Üí revenue = 20 √ó 15 = 300
  - Total revenue = 800, total units = 115 ‚Üí average price = 800/115 ‚âà 6.96

- **Product 2**:
  - On 2019-02-10, price was 15 ‚Üí revenue = 15 √ó 200 = 3000
  - On 2019-03-22, price was 30 ‚Üí revenue = 30 √ó 30 = 900
  - Total revenue = 3900, total units = 230 ‚Üí average price = 3900/230 ‚âà 16.96

### üß† Approach

1. Join `Prices` and `UnitsSold` on:
    - product_id
    - purchase_date between start_date and end_date

2. For each matching record, calculate revenue:
    ```
    revenue = units * price
    ```

3. Group by product_id:
    - sum revenue
    - sum units
    - divide to get average price

4. Handle products with no sales:
    - Return 0 as average price.

### ‚úÖ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    IFNULL(
        ROUND(SUM(u.units * p.price) / SUM(u.units), 2),
        0
    ) AS average_price
FROM 
    Prices p
LEFT JOIN 
    UnitsSold u
    ON p.product_id = u.product_id 
   AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY 
    p.product_id;
```
