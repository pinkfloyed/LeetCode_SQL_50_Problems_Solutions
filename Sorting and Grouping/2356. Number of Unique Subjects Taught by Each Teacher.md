### ✅ Input

**Teacher table**:

| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 2          | 3       |

### 💡 Output

| teacher_id | cnt |
|------------|-----|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |

### 🧠 Explanation

- **Teacher 1**:
  - Teaches subject `2` in departments `3` and `4` → only counts once.
  - Teaches subject `3` in department `3`.
  - So, **2 unique subjects**.

- **Teacher 2**:
  - Teaches subjects `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, all in department `1`.
  - So, **4 unique subjects**.
