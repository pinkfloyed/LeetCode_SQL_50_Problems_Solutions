# 🧠 Problem 2 : Patients With a Condition

You are given a `Patients` table that includes information about hospital patients and their medical conditions. Each patient's `conditions` field contains **0 or more medical condition codes separated by spaces**.

Your task is to find all patients who have **Type I Diabetes**, which is always represented by a condition **starting with the prefix `DIAB1`**.

---

# 📋 Task

Write a SQL query to return the `patient_id`, `patient_name`, and `conditions` of all patients who have **at least one condition code** that starts with `"DIAB1"`.

Return the results in **any order**.

---

# 📘 Input

### Table: `Patients`

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| patient_id   | int     |
| patient_name | varchar |
| conditions   | varchar |

- `patient_id` is the primary key.
- `conditions` may contain multiple condition codes separated by spaces.
- `conditions` may be empty (i.e., an empty string `''`).

---

# 📤 Output

| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| int        | varchar      | varchar      |

Return the records of patients who have a condition code that begins with `DIAB1`.

# 🧪 Example

### Input:

| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |
| 2          | Alice        |              |
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
| 5          | Alain        | DIAB201      |

### Output:

| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |

---

# 🔍 Explanation

- Bob's conditions: `"DIAB100 MYOP"` → contains a condition that starts with `DIAB1`.
- George's conditions: `"ACNE DIAB100"` → one of the conditions starts with `DIAB1`.
- Alain's condition: `"DIAB201"` → **does not** start with `DIAB1`, so it is not included.

---

# 💡 Approach

We use the `LIKE` operator to check:
1. If the string starts with `DIAB1` (`'DIAB1%'`)
2. Or if it contains `' DIAB1'` somewhere after a space (to match condition codes not at the beginning)

This ensures that we correctly identify all conditions that start with `DIAB1`.

---

# 🧾 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Patients 
WHERE conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%' OR conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%';
