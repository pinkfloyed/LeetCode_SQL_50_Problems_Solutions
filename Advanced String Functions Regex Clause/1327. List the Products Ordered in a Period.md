# 🧠 Problem 6 : List the Products Ordered in a Period

You are given two tables: `Products` and `Orders`.  
Each product may have multiple orders over time.

Your task is to **find the names of products** that had **at least 100 units ordered** in **February 2020**, and show the **total units ordered** for each.

---

# 📋 Task

Write a SQL query that returns:
- `product_name`: the name of the product
- `unit`: total number of units ordered in February 2020

Only include products that had **≥ 100 units ordered** in that month.

---

# 📘 Input

### Table: `Products`

| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| product_id       | int     |
| product_name     | varchar |
| product_category | varchar |

- `product_id` is the primary key.
- Each row represents a product.

### Table: `Orders`

| Column Name   | Type |
|---------------|------|
| product_id    | int  |
| order_date    | date |
| unit          | int  |

- `product_id` is a foreign key to `Products.product_id`.
- Each row represents an order (date and quantity).

---

# 📤 Output

| product_name       | unit |
|--------------------|------|
| varchar            | int  |

Return all products with **≥ 100 units ordered in February 2020**, in **any order**.

| 5          | 2020-02-27 | 50   |

### Output:

| product_name       | unit |
|--------------------|------|
| Leetcode Solutions | 130  |
| Leetcode Kit       | 100  |

# 🔍 Explanation

- **Product 1**: 60 + 70 = **130** units in Feb → included.
- **Product 2**: Only 80 units → not included.
- **Product 3**: 2 + 3 = 5 → not included.
- **Product 4**: Ordered only in March → not included.
- **Product 5**: 50 + 50 = **100** units → included.

---

# 💡 Approach

1. **Join** `Products` with `Orders` using `product_id`.
2. **Filter** only rows where `order_date` is in **February 2020**.
3. **Group** by `product_id` to get total units ordered per product.
4. Use **`HAVING`** to keep only those with `sum(units) ≥ 100`.
5. Return the `product_name` and total `unit`.

# 🧾 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.unit) AS unit
FROM Products p
JOIN Orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
WHERE o.order_date LIKE '2020-02%'
GROUP BY p.product_id
HAVING SUM(o.unit) >= 100;
