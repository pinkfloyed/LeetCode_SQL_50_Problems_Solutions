# 🧠 Problem 1 : Fix Names in a Table

You are given a `Users` table that contains user names. Some names are inconsistently capitalized (e.g., "aLice", "bOB"). Your task is to **format the names** so that:
- Only the **first letter is uppercase**
- The **remaining letters are lowercase**

---

# 📋 Task

Write a SQL query to return the corrected names, with only the first character capitalized and the rest in lowercase.

Return the results **ordered by `user_id`**.

---

# 📘 Input

### Table: `Users`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | int     |
| name        | varchar |

- `user_id` is the primary key.
- `name` contains a user's name using uppercase and lowercase letters in any order.

---

# 📤 Output

| user_id | name  |
|---------|-------|
| int     | varchar |

Return each user's ID and correctly capitalized name.

---

# 🧪 Example

### Input:

| user_id | name  |
|---------|-------|
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |

### Output:

| user_id | name  |
|---------|-------|
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |

---

# 🔍 Explanation

- "aLice" → "Alice": First letter is uppercased, rest is lowercased.
- "bOB" → "Bob": Same transformation.

---

# 💡 Approach

Use SQL string functions:
- `LEFT(name, 1)` gets the first character.
- `SUBSTRING(name, 2)` gets the rest of the string.
- `UPPER()` capitalizes the first letter.
- `LOWER()` lowercases the remaining letters.
- `CONCAT()` joins them together.

---

# 🧾 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT user_id, 
       CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;
