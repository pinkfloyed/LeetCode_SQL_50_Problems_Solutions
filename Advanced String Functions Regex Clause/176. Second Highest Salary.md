# 🧠 Problem 4 : Second Highest Salary

You are given an `Employee` table that stores employee IDs and their salaries. Your task is to find the **second highest distinct salary**.

If there is no second highest salary (i.e., only one unique salary), you should return `null`.

---

# 📋 Task

Write a SQL query that returns a single column named `SecondHighestSalary`, which contains:
- The **second highest unique salary** if it exists
- Otherwise, `null`

---

# 📘 Input

### Table: `Employee`

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |

- `id` is the primary key.
- Each row contains an employee's salary.

---

# 📤 Output

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| int or null         |

Return one row with the second highest distinct salary, or `null` if it doesn’t exist.

---

# 🧪 Example

### Example 1

#### Input:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

#### Output:

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| 200                 |

---

### Example 2

#### Input:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |

#### Output:

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| null                |

---

# 🔍 Explanation

- In Example 1, salaries are: 100, 200, 300 → second highest = 200.
- In Example 2, only one salary exists → second highest = `null`.

---

# 💡 Approach

- Use a **subquery** to get the highest salary.
- Then filter salaries that are **less than** the highest.
- From that filtered list, take the **maximum**, which is the second highest.

---

# 🧾 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee
);
