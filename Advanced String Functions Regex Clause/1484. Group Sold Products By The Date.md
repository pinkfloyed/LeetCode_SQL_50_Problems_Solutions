# üß† Problem 5 : Group Sold Products By The Date

You are given a table `Activities` that records the sales of products with their sale dates. Each row contains a product and the date it was sold. The table may contain duplicates.

Your goal is to:
1. Find the **number of distinct products** sold on each date.
2. List all the **distinct product names** sold on that date, **sorted lexicographically**, and separated by commas.

---

# üìã Task

Write a SQL query to return:
- `sell_date`: the date of the sale
- `num_sold`: number of distinct products sold on that date
- `products`: a comma-separated string of the product names, sorted in lexicographic order

---

# üìò Input

### Table: `Activities`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |

- There is no primary key; duplicates may exist.
- Each row records a product sold on a specific date.

---

# üì§ Output

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| date       | int      | varchar                      |

Return one row per unique `sell_date`, ordered by `sell_date` in ascending order.

# üß™ Example

### Input:

| sell_date  | product     |
|------------|-------------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible       |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |

### Output:

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-Shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |

# üîç Explanation

- For **2020-05-30**: Products = Basketball, Headphone, T-Shirt ‚Üí Count = 3
- For **2020-06-01**: Products = Bible, Pencil ‚Üí Count = 2
- For **2020-06-02**: Product = Mask ‚Üí Count = 1  
  (duplicate Mask is counted only once)

---

# üí° Approach

- Use `GROUP BY sell_date` to aggregate results by date.
- Use `COUNT(DISTINCT product)` to get the number of unique products per date.
- Use `GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',')` to get a sorted, comma-separated list of products per date.
- Order the final result by `sell_date`.

---

# üßæ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM Activities 
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
