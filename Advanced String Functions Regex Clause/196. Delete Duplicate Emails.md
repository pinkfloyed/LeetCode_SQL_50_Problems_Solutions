# 🧠 Problem 3 : Delete Duplicate Emails 

You are given a `Person` table containing email addresses. Some emails may appear multiple times in the table. Your task is to **delete all duplicate rows**, keeping only the row with the **smallest `id`** for each email.

---

# 📋 Task

Write a **`DELETE`** SQL statement to remove duplicate emails.  
Keep only one row for each email — the one with the **lowest `id`**.

---

# 📘 Input

### Table: `Person`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |

- `id` is the primary key.
- Emails are guaranteed to be in lowercase.
- Some emails may be duplicated across multiple rows.

---

# 📤 Output

The `Person` table should retain only **unique emails**, with the smallest `id` for each. The output order does not matter.

---

# 🧪 Example

### Input:

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

### Output:

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |

---

# 🔍 Explanation

- `john@example.com` appears twice — rows with `id = 1` and `id = 3`.
- We **delete row `id = 3`**, keeping the one with the smaller `id = 1`.

---

# 💡 Approach

- Use a **self-join** to find rows with the **same email** but **higher `id`** than another.
- Delete the rows where there exists a duplicate with a **smaller `id`**.
- Syntax: `DELETE p1 FROM Person p1, Person p2 WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id`

---

# 🧾 SQL Solution

```sql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;
