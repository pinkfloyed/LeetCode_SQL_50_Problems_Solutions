# Problem 9 : Confirmation Rate

---

## Tables

### Signups

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| user_id     | int      |
| time_stamp  | datetime |

- `user_id` is unique in this table.
- Each row shows when a user signed up.

### Confirmations

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| user_id     | int      |
| time_stamp  | datetime |
| action      | ENUM     |

- `(user_id, time_stamp)` is the primary key.
- `user_id` references `Signups.user_id`.
- `action` can be either `'confirmed'` or `'timeout'`.
- Each row shows a confirmation message request and its status.

---

## Task

Calculate the confirmation rate for each user, defined as:

confirmation rate} = number of 'confirmed' messages/total number of requested confirmations

- If a user did not request any confirmation messages, their rate is 0.
- Round the result to two decimal places.
- Return the result for all users from `Signups`.

## Example

### Input

**Signups**

| user_id | time_stamp          |
|---------|---------------------|
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 |

**Confirmations**

| user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-13 12:58:28 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |

### Output

| user_id | confirmation_rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |

## Explanation

- User 6 requested no confirmations → rate 0.
- User 3 requested twice, both timed out → rate 0.
- User 7 requested 3 times, all confirmed → rate 1.
- User 2 requested twice, one confirmed, one timeout → rate 0.5.

## Approach

1. **Join the Tables**  
   Perform a LEFT JOIN between the `Signups` table and the `Confirmations` table on `user_id`.  
   This ensures that all users appear in the result, even if they have no confirmation requests.

2. **Calculate Confirmation Rate**  
   - For each user, count how many confirmation actions are `'confirmed'`.  
   - Count the total number of confirmation actions requested by the user (both `'confirmed'` and `'timeout'`).  
   - Use the average of a boolean expression (`IF(c.action='confirmed', 1, 0)`) to calculate the confirmation rate as the ratio of confirmed requests to total requests.  
   - Use `ROUND(..., 2)` to round the result to two decimal places.

3. **Handle Users Without Confirmation Requests**  
   Since we use LEFT JOIN, users with no confirmation records will have NULLs in `c.action`.  
   The `AVG(IF(...))` will correctly compute as 0 in that case.

4. **Group and Order**  
   Group results by `user_id` to get each user's confirmation rate.

## ✅ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    s.user_id,
    ROUND(AVG(IF(c.action = 'confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM 
    Signups s
LEFT JOIN 
    Confirmations c ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY 
    s.user_id;
