# Problem 8 : Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

---

## Table

### Employee

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |

- `id` is the primary key.
- Each row indicates the name, department, and manager ID of an employee.
- If `managerId` is `null`, the employee has no manager.
- No employee is their own manager.

---

## Task

Write a SQL query to find the names of managers who have at least five direct reports.

Return the result in any order.

## Example

### Input

| id  | name  | department | managerId |
|-----|-------|------------|-----------|
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |

### Output

| name |
|------|
| John |

## Approach

1. **Join the Employee table with itself**:  
   - Use a self-join where `e1.id = e2.managerId`.  
   - This links each manager (`e1`) to their direct reports (`e2`).

2. **Group by the manager's ID and name**:  
   - Grouping helps to count the number of direct reports for each manager.

3. **Filter the groups having count of direct reports >= 5**:  
   - Use `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5` to get only those managers with five or more reports.

4. **Select the manager's name** as the final output.

## âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT e1.name
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2
  ON e1.id = e2.managerId
GROUP BY e2.managerId, e1.name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
