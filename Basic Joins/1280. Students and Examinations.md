# Problem 7 : Students and Examinations

---

## Tables

### Students

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| student_id   | int     |
| student_name | varchar |

- `student_id` is the primary key.
- Each row contains the ID and name of a student.

### Subjects

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| subject_name | varchar |

- `subject_name` is the primary key.
- Each row contains the name of one subject.

### Examinations

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| student_id   | int     |
| subject_name | varchar |

- No primary key (may contain duplicates).
- Each student from the Students table takes every subject from the Subjects table.
- Each row indicates a student attended the exam for a subject.

## Task

Write a SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the results ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

## Example

### Input

**Students**

| student_id | student_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 13         | John         |
| 6          | Alex         |

**Subjects**

| subject_name |
|--------------|
| Math         |
| Physics      |
| Programming  |

**Examinations**

| student_id | subject_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Programming  |
| 2          | Programming  |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Math         |
| 13         | Math         |
| 13         | Programming  |
| 13         | Physics      |
| 2          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |

### Output

| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |

### Explanation

- The result includes all students and all subjects.
- Alice attended Math 3 times, Physics 2 times, and Programming once.
- Bob attended Math and Programming once each, but did not attend Physics.
- Alex did not attend any exams.
- John attended each subject once.

## ðŸ’» SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    t.subject_name,
    COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM
    Students s
CROSS JOIN
    Subjects t
LEFT JOIN
    Examinations e
ON
    s.student_id = e.student_id
    AND t.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    t.subject_name
ORDER BY
    s.student_id,
    t.subject_name ASC;
