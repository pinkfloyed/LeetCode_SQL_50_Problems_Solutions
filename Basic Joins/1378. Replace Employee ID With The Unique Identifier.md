# Problem 01 - Employee Unique IDs

---

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement

Table: **Employees**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

- `id` is the primary key (unique identifier) for this table.
- Each row represents an employee in the company.

---

Table: **EmployeeUNI**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| unique_id   | int     |

- `(id, unique_id)` is the composite primary key for this table.
- Each row links an employeeâ€™s `id` to their unique company identifier.

---

### Task

Write a SQL query to display each employeeâ€™s `unique_id` along with their `name`.

- If an employee does **not** have a unique ID in `EmployeeUNI`, display `NULL` for their unique_id instead.

Return the result in any order.

## ðŸ§ª Example

### Input

**Employees**

| id  | name     |
|-----|----------|
| 1   | Alice    |
| 7   | Bob      |
| 11  | Meir     |
| 90  | Winston  |
| 3   | Jonathan |

**EmployeeUNI**

| id  | unique_id |
|-----|-----------|
| 3   | 1         |
| 11  | 2         |
| 90  | 3         |

---

### Output

| unique_id | name     |
|-----------|----------|
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |

**Explanation:**

- Alice and Bob do **not** have a unique ID in `EmployeeUNI`.
- The other employees have their corresponding unique IDs.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

- We need to combine data from both tables.
- We perform a **LEFT JOIN**:
  - From `Employees` â†’ always keep all employees
  - Join on `id` with `EmployeeUNI` to fetch the `unique_id` when it exists
- For employees with no match in `EmployeeUNI`, the `unique_id` will be `NULL`.

---

## âœ… Solution

```sql
SELECT e.unique_id, f.name
FROM Employees f LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI e
ON f.id = e.id;
