# Problem 04 - Weather Temperature Increase

---

## ğŸ“„ Problem Statement

**Table:** Weather

| Column Name  | Type |
|--------------|------|
| id           | int  |
| recordDate   | date |
| temperature  | int  |

- `id` is unique.
- No two rows share the same `recordDate`.
- Each row records the temperature on a specific day.

---

### Task

Find all `id`s where the temperature on that date is **higher than the temperature on the previous day** (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

---

## ğŸ§ª Example

**Input**

| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |

**Output**

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

**Explanation**

- On 2015-01-02, temperature (25) is higher than previous day (10).
- On 2015-01-04, temperature (30) is higher than previous day (20).

---

## ğŸ’¡ Approach

- Join the table to itself using the condition that the dates are exactly one day apart (`datediff(a.recordDate, b.recordDate) = 1`).
- Compare the temperatures of the two days.
- Select the `id` of the day with the higher temperature.

---

## âœ… Solution

```sql
SELECT a.id
FROM Weather a
JOIN Weather b
ON DATEDIFF(a.recordDate, b.recordDate) = 1
WHERE a.temperature > b.temperature;
