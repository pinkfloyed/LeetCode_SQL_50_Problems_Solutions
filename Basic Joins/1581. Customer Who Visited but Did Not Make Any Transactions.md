## ðŸ§ª Example

**Input**

**Visits**

| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |

**Transactions**

| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |

---

**Output**

| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

**Explanation:**

- Customer 23 made a transaction during visit 1 â†’ excluded.
- Customer 9 made a transaction during visit 2 â†’ excluded.
- Customer 30 visited once with no transactions â†’ counted.
- Customer 54 visited 3 times:
  - visit 5 â†’ had transactions
  - visits 7, 8 â†’ no transactions â†’ counted as 2 visits.
- Customer 96 visited once with no transactions â†’ counted.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

- Perform a **LEFT JOIN** from `Visits` to `Transactions` using `visit_id`.
- Identify rows where `Transactions.visit_id` is NULL (i.e. no transaction occurred for that visit).
- Group by `customer_id`.
- Count the number of such visits for each customer.

## âœ… Solution

```sql
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v LEFT JOIN Transactions t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
